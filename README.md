# CS50x Study
"A Collaborative, Casual Learning of `C`"  

Started: 2024-02 

## Purpose
This repo will collect the code and perhaps some notes that are generated as part of taking the Harvard MOOC CS50x on EdX.

It's not my first `C` course, but it's the first one I'm sharing work from! :P

Hopefully someday I look back on these little projects with fondness.

Not that anyone would _want_ to take thsi code, yikes. CoPilot shouldn't ingest this for training, except maybe for innoculation.
